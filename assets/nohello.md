**About the no-hello protocol:**

When you send an email, avoid just saying "Hi" or greetings alone without your question or request. For example, don’t do this:

```
Hi  
[wait for reply]  
Now I ask my question...
```

That makes the person wait and wastes time, like calling someone and putting them on hold.

Instead, write your question right away, like this:

```
Hi — I’m working on [project] and I need help with [issue]. Could you please assist?
```

This way, the reader understands your request immediately and can start helping faster. It also works better if they reply later asynchronously.

If you want to be polite, you can add something like:

```
Hi — if you’re not busy, I have a quick question about [topic]...
```

Following this helps speed up responses and improves communication. Your email will be answered as quickly as possible!
